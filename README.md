### KickStart Crowdcoin - Web3 App

This Web3 App was developed while I took a course on Ethereum Development.

Primary aim is to help fund raising.  It does have a contract built with solidity, compiled & can be deployed for use.

## Ingredients
- Next JS
- Solidity
- Web 3
- Ganache
- Semantic UI
- Mocha

## Features
- User can create a crowdfund campaign
- Users can contribute to a crowfund
- A Voting systems by the contributors on whether any campaign funds should be sent to vendor
- Only Admin(Contract Deployer) can release a campaign fund to a vendor

To `compile` the project, simple `cd` into the `ethereum` folder and run `node compile`

Run Test:
 - To run tests, in the project folder root directory, run `npm run test`. That'll use the mocha library to run all the tests written inside the  `test` folder.
